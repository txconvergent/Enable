# enable
_by [Convergent](http://txconvergent.org)_

The platform that enables recruiters, investors, founders, and early talent to connect with one another.

Here, **students** can upload pitch videos, slide decks, proposals, product demos, mock-ups, and so on. **Founders** can find potential business partners with the skills they need to help build out their idea, and **talent** can pick up projects to work on. **Investors** and other users can leave comments on startup proposals, and **recruiters** can view students' resumes, skills, and _proof_ of their projects.

**Core contributor's note**: It's in progress and currently closed to parties affiliated with Convergent. Here's an actual screenshot of the profile feature:

We're making improvements to _Enable_ every day, and are preparing it for open source soon (we'll attempt to port the commit history from the private repo it's currently on, over to this repo).
